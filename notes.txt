Using Beautiful Soup on the location info page:

First, use requests to get a link: e.g. r = requests.get("http://purple.com")
Then the actual html would be r.content
Then use Beautiful Soup on that.


python -i example_urls.py 

>>> link = availability[1]
>>> raw_html = requests.get(link)
>>> raw_html.content
(big chunk of HTML)

>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
>>> soup = BeautifulSoup(raw_html.content)
WARNS me about html parser!

So instead:
 >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(raw_html.content, "html.parser")

Now for each one, I can look at repr, or the text, etc.

Things without whitespace: soup.stripped_strings

To get the classes of an element, do whatever['class'], get a list of classes.
or whatever.attrs will show {'class' : blah}
