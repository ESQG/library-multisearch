Featurs I want:

0. Clickable map


1b. (big) Goodreads OAuth, hopefully?
1a. Regular login

(Friday) Input books without Goodreads

2. Digital records!



3. Check availability once a day; have "doublecheck this" button
Write the "chron-job", something I can run to doublecheck availability.


Back burner:
Other libraries that use BiblioCommons
Different shelves for a single user?? (my little sister wants this)
    Different shelves for Goodreads user?

User picks branches?  -- use for Twilio push notifications? (check at 9am daily?)  Set notifications for specific books
