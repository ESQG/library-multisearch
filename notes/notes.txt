Could use if format doesn't show up in initial results:
secondaries = [x for x in soup.find_all('div') if 'class' in x.attrs and 'secondary_info' in x['class']]
formats = [x for x in spans if 'class' in x.attrs and 'format' in x['class']]

Rewrite data_manager function: just track call numbers, i.e. already updated ones, then leave updated ones alone unless updating to say it's available

Might as well make lots of AJAX calls so results are showing up right away

Server-side session: keeps session on server side
Flask extension with session.  Still using session object, uses database, but API is via session

Could do single-page application so data persists in browser
Or use cacheing tool?
Henry thinks head start problem is good idea, tricky

Work on AJAX calls on next page, then come back to this preloading issue.  Interesting problem to discuss and show off.
